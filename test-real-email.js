      body: `Dear Team,

This is a critical reminder that our major client contract renewal is due by this Friday, December 6th.

The client has expressed concerns about our service levels over the past quarter and is considering alternative vendors. We need to:

1. Prepare a comprehensive service improvement proposal
2. Address their specific concerns about response times
3. Offer competitive pricing to retain the business
4. Schedule an executive review meeting before Friday

This contract represents approximately $2M in annual revenue. Losing it would significantly impact our Q4 results.

Please prioritize this and provide your input by end of day tomorrow.

Regards,
Michael Chen
Sales Director`,
